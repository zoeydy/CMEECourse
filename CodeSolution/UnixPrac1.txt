#Count how many lines there are in each file
wc -l *.fasta 
# EXPLANATION:
# wc prints newline, word, and byte counts for a file
# -l flag restricts the counting to just newlines

# Print everything starting from the second line for the E. coli genome
tail -n+2 407228326.fasta
# EXPLANATION:
# 


# Count the sequence length of this genome
tail -n+2 407228326.fasta | tr -d "\n" | wc -c

# Count the matches of a particular sequence, ``ATGC'' in the genome of E. coli 
tail -n+2 E.coli.fasta | tr -d "\n" | grep -o "ATGC" | wc -l

# Compute the AT/GC ratio
echo $(tail -n+2 E.coli.fasta | tr -d "\n" | grep -o [A,T] | wc -l) / $(tail -n+2 E.coli.fasta | tr -d "\n" | grep -o [G,C] | wc -l) | bc -l
# EXPLANATION:
# bc is the UNIX "bench calculator"
