Welcome to HPC 2020 (James Rosindell)
To get started....

1.) rename the folder 'jrosinde' within 'model code' to read your username instead of mine
2.) rename all three files within the 'jrosinde' folder so that they start with your username instead of mine - but don't change the file names in any other way
3.) open the file ending in main.R and the 'my test file HPC 2020.R' file in R studio
4.) read the HPC excercises 2020.pdf file and the mark scheme
5.) get started coding writing your completed work in the main.R file and using the test file as a way to test what you've done.

Please keep checking up in the repo during the course for more updates.

Please only use the materials for your CMEE course at Imperial College London. Please don't repost them elsewhere as this might spoil the course for future years by letting people see hints and surprises in advance.

I hope you enjoy the course,

James
