# Biological Computing in R
Basic R syntax and programming conventions, assuming you have never set your eyes on R

Principles of data processing and exploration (including visualization) using R

Principles of clean and efficient programming using R

To generate publication quality graphics in R

To develop reproducible data analysis “work flows” so you (or anybody else) can run and re-run your analyses, graphics outputs and all, in R

To make R simulations more efficient using vectorization

To find and fix errors in R code using debugging

T make data wrangling and analyses more efficient and convenient using custom tools such as tidyr

Some additional tools and topics in R (accessing databases, building your own packages, etc.)

# Biological Computing in Python II
learning some data analysis packages in python such as numpy scipy, and learning python to build workflow.
